# ðŸšš ANT Trucks: Big Data Project ðŸšš

Welcome to the **ANT Trucks Big Data Project** repository! This project focuses on analyzing road safety and operational compliance for commercial truck fleets across the United States. Using big data technologies, the project identifies high-risk truck models, drivers, and cities, and provides actionable recommendations to enhance fleet safety and efficiency.

This repository contains presentation slides summarizing the data analysis workflow, key findings, risk assessment, and recommendations for improving truck fleet operations.

## ðŸ“„ About the Project

ANT Trucks manages a nationwide commercial trucking fleet and aims to improve safety and compliance on the road. The project processes large-scale geographic, vehicle, and driver data to identify patterns related to incidents, driver behavior, and vehicle performance.

The analysis leverages technologies such as **Hadoop**, **Hive**, **Impala**, and **Tableau** to handle and visualize complex datasets and generate insights.

The repository includes the following file:
- `ANT-Trucks.pdf`: Presentation slides detailing the analysis process, workflow diagrams, dashboards, key findings, and recommendations for fleet management.

## ðŸŽ“ Key Insights and Concepts Learned

Through the ANT Trucks Big Data Project, I gained practical experience in the following areas:

1. **Data Processing and Querying at Scale**  
   Utilized **Hadoop**, **Hive**, and **Impala** for processing large-scale, complex datasets including geographic, vehicle, and driver data. Developed efficient queries to extract relevant event and mileage metrics.

2. **Data Visualization and Dashboarding**  
   Created insightful dashboards in **Tableau** to visualize incident patterns, driver risk scores, and vehicle efficiency. Designed clear visualizations to support decision-making for fleet managers.

3. **Risk Analysis and Correlation Identification**  
   Discovered correlations such as high mileage linked with increased event counts. Identified specific truck models (Ford, Caterpillar, Peterbilt) and cities (Santa Rosa, Willits) with elevated risk profiles.

4. **Driver Behavior Assessment**  
   Analyzed driver-specific risk scores to highlight unsafe driving habits. Learned how to flag and prioritize high-risk drivers for retraining interventions.

5. **Vehicle Performance Evaluation**  
   Compared fuel efficiency across truck models to optimize route assignments. Used data-driven insights to recommend model-specific maintenance schedules.

6. **Operational Recommendations**  
   Suggested actionable strategies including driver risk monitoring, route optimization, and behavior-based alert systems. Emphasized continuous feedback loops through monthly dashboards and real-time alerts to improve safety outcomes.

7. **Big Data Project Workflow**  
   Gained hands-on experience managing end-to-end big data analytics projects, from data ingestion to insight delivery. Collaborated on data cleaning, querying, visualization, and reporting phases.
